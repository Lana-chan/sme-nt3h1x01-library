This is a library for the NXP NT3H1101 component.
The NTAG I²C is the first product of NXP’s NTAG family offering both contactless and contact interfaces. 
In addition to the passive NFC Forum compliant contactless interface, the IC features an I²C contact interface, 
which can communicate with a microcontroller if the NTAG I²C is powered from an external power supply.

This component use I2C to communicate, no extra pin are required.

It was principally designed to work with the SmartEverything board, but could
be easily adapt and use on every Arduino and Arduino Certified boards.
